## ZK Co-creation's Contract. 

This Contract is the backbone of our innovative privacy system, Under the guarantee of zk-SNARK, users in forge can realize the privacy protection of the whole process.
1. "Proof of Creation": Based on zk technology, users can submit their creations and prove the validity of their submissions without disclosing the content at all.
2. "Inspiration Proof": Based on zk-SNARK and Magiry.AI, users can prove the originality of their inspirations without disclosing the specific content, but at the same time be able to publicize their inspirations to inspire others
3. "Double-blind voting": based on zk's one-way function, users can prove the validity of their votes without disclosing their behavior.

we believe that zk, while being a bottom-line privacy weapon, is at the same time a necessary stepping stone to consensus.

## MagipopMap's Contract. 

forge map enable creators to collaborate on fan fiction storyline under same worldview just like playing game - user’s idea will be analyzed by our AI system and turn to a spot on map linking to other creators’ idea.

This Contract is the backbone of our innovative mapping system, combining the power of blockchain, AI, and collaborative creativity.
Our contract begins by initializing the contract hash, paving the way for secure and transparent operations. It's the bridge that connects creators and their ideas.
With methods like "post" and "detail_of," we empower creators to post data and retrieve it when needed. This fosters a dynamic environment where ideas flow freely, and collaboration thrives.

## Magiry.AI

But what truly sets us apart is Magiry.AI. It's our creative assistant, represented by the "detail_of" method. Magiry.AI weaves together the threads of different creators' ideas into a structured map, making co-creation akin to building a story with LEGO pieces.
